# Release Automation Rules v1.0

## Overview

This document defines the comprehensive release automation rules for codex-synaptic, implementing semantic versioning, automated workflows, and quality gates to ensure reliable and consistent releases with minimal manual intervention.

## Semantic Versioning Strategy

### Version Format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

#### Major Version Increments (Breaking Changes)
- **Breaking CLI Changes**: Command-line interface modifications that break existing usage
- **Memory Schema Changes**: Incompatible changes to database or memory structures
- **API Breaking Changes**: Public API modifications that break backwards compatibility
- **Configuration Format Changes**: Incompatible configuration file format changes
- **Protocol Breaking Changes**: Network protocol changes affecting bridge compatibility
- **Agent Interface Changes**: Breaking changes to agent contracts or capabilities

**Examples:**
- Removing CLI commands or changing required parameters
- Modifying agent interface contracts
- Changing consensus algorithm interfaces
- Breaking MCP/A2A protocol compatibility
- Incompatible YAML schema changes

**Migration Requirements:**
- Migration guide documentation
- Backward compatibility shims when possible
- Clear deprecation warnings in previous minor versions
- Extended support period for previous major version

#### Minor Version Increments (New Features)
- **New Algorithm Implementations**: Additional swarm or consensus algorithms
- **Additive Command Features**: New CLI commands or optional parameters
- **New Agent Types**: Additional agent capabilities
- **Enhanced Bridge Protocols**: New bridge functionality maintaining compatibility
- **Performance Improvements**: Non-breaking performance enhancements
- **New Telemetry Features**: Additional monitoring and observability capabilities

**Examples:**
- Adding new swarm optimization algorithms (genetic algorithms, simulated annealing)
- New CLI commands for telemetry or monitoring
- Additional consensus mechanisms (proof-of-stake variants)
- Enhanced memory bridge capabilities
- New security policies and validations

**Feature Requirements:**
- Comprehensive documentation
- Integration tests covering new functionality
- Feature flags for gradual rollout
- Performance impact assessment

#### Patch Version Increments (Bug Fixes)
- **Bug Fixes**: Correcting defects without changing functionality
- **Performance Tweaks**: Minor optimizations without interface changes
- **Documentation Updates**: Improvements to documentation and examples
- **Security Patches**: Security fixes that don't break compatibility
- **Dependency Updates**: Non-breaking dependency version updates

**Examples:**
- Fixing swarm convergence issues
- Correcting memory leak in agent lifecycle
- Updating security certificates
- Fixing typos in documentation
- Resolving telemetry data accuracy issues

**Patch Requirements:**
- Regression tests to prevent re-occurrence
- Impact assessment for critical patches
- Hotfix process for security vulnerabilities

```

### Deployment Automation

#### Staging Environment
```yaml
staging_deployment:
  trigger: "release_candidate_created"
  environment: "staging"
  
  steps:
    - deploy_containers
    - run_smoke_tests
    - performance_validation
    - security_scan
    - manual_approval_required
```

#### Production Deployment
```yaml
production_deployment:
  trigger: "release_published"
  environment: "production"
  
  strategy: "blue_green"
  rollback_enabled: true
  health_checks_required: true
  
  steps:
